**Polymarket** is a decentralized information markets platform built on blockchain technology (originally Ethereum, now often using Polygon for lower fees). It allows users to **bet on the outcomes of real-world events** using cryptocurrency (typically USDC).

### Key Features:

- **Prediction Markets**: Users can buy and sell shares in the outcomes of future events (e.g., “Will Trump win the 2024 election?” or “Will Bitcoin be above $70k by end of August?”).
- **On-Chain Settlement**: Outcomes are resolved using a decentralized oracle system (e.g., UMA), so markets are trust-minimized.
- **Market-Based Forecasts**: The current price of "Yes" shares in a market reflects the probability the market thinks the event will occur (e.g., if “Yes” is trading at $0.70, the market estimates a 70% chance of that outcome).

### Use Cases:

- Forecasting politics, sports, crypto, tech developments, and more
- Gathering sentiment data on uncertain future events
- Speculative trading based on personal insight or public trends

### Legal Note:

Polymarket is geo-restricted in certain regions, including the U.S. (for real-money trading), due to regulatory concerns. In January 2022, the CFTC fined them and required them to limit U.S. user access to some markets.
