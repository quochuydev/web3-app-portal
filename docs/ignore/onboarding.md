As a software engineer, here's a **step-by-step technical breakdown** of the **user onboarding flow** for **Polymarket**, focusing on how a decentralized prediction platform typically works.

This assumes you're building or analyzing a Web3 DApp experience:

---

## 🔁 1. **Landing Page + App Intro**

- **User visits polymarket.com**

  - **Frontend**: React (or similar SPA framework), using Web3 libraries (e.g., `wagmi`, `ethers`, `viem`) to prepare for wallet connection.
  - **Backend**: Mostly read-only operations done via APIs or direct calls to the blockchain (via RPC nodes or GraphQL with The Graph).

---

## 👛 2. **Connect Wallet**

- **Trigger**: User clicks “Connect Wallet” button.

- **Options**:

  - MetaMask
  - WalletConnect
  - Coinbase Wallet
  - Embedded wallet (optional in some Web3 DApps)

- **Flow**:

  - UI triggers a `connect` function using `wagmi` or `web3modal`.
  - Ethereum provider is injected (e.g., MetaMask).
  - Wallet signature may be requested to verify identity (e.g., EIP-4361 `Sign-In With Ethereum`).

---

## 🔗 3. **Check Network**

- Polymarket runs on **Polygon (PoS)**.
- User is prompted to switch network if not on Polygon.

  - Done programmatically via `wallet_addEthereumChain` RPC call.

---

## 🛂 4. **KYC / Geo-Restriction Enforcement (if applicable)**

- Since Polymarket restricts U.S. users from trading:

  - A **geo-check** may be triggered using the user’s IP (via backend) or by requiring a **blocklist verification**.
  - For higher compliance, optional **KYC process** (e.g., with providers like Jumio, Persona) could be introduced — but not always used onchain.

---

## 💼 5. **User Wallet State Initialization**

- App queries:

  - USDC balance on Polygon (ERC-20 token).
  - User’s share positions in active markets.
  - Transaction history.

- These are done via:

  - **The Graph** subgraphs for indexed queries
  - **Direct RPC calls** for current balances
  - **Smart contracts** for real-time market data

---

## 💰 6. **Funding the Wallet (Optional Step)**

If the user doesn’t have USDC:

- Show UI to:

  - Bridge from Ethereum/mainnet (via third-party like Hop, Across)
  - Buy with card (via MoonPay, Transak)
  - Swap MATIC to USDC on Polygon (via 0x API or DEX aggregator)

---

## 📈 7. **Explore Markets**

- User sees a list of prediction markets (e.g., “Will X happen by Y date?”)

  - Pulled via The Graph or backend API
  - Each market has:

    - Title, description
    - Current odds (price of “Yes” / “No” shares)
    - Volume/liquidity
    - Resolution source (how the outcome is verified)

---

## 🛒 8. **Buy Shares / Trade**

- User selects a market and enters trade amount.
- Trade transaction is prepared:

  - **Smart contract interaction**: send USDC to buy shares of an outcome (YES/NO).
  - User signs + sends transaction via wallet.
  - Transaction is submitted to Polygon network.

- Backend updates frontend state upon confirmation (via polling or event listeners).

---

## 📬 9. **Track Bets**

- Dashboard shows:

  - Current positions
  - Unrealized profit/loss
  - Market resolution status

---

## 🧾 10. **Market Resolution**

- After the event:

  - Outcome is confirmed via an oracle (e.g., UMA).
  - Winning shares can be **redeemed** for USDC.
  - User signs transaction to **settle position** and claim winnings.

---

## Optional Components:

- **Notifications**: Email or wallet push notifications for resolved markets or expiring trades.
- **Social/Referral Systems**: Onboarding friends may provide bonuses.
- **Gamification**: XP, ranks, or streaks for engagement.

---

## ⚠️ Compliance & Edge Cases

- **Restricted regions** are blocked via IP or wallet tagging.
- **Smart contract risks**: Frontend may warn users of risks and emphasize self-custody.
- **Slippage handling** for low-liquidity trades.
